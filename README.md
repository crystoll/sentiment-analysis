# Demo of using Stanford NLP Core module in a modern Java application

https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/

To get started:

- Need to have Java 17, or alter the pom.xml accordingly (and change the code)
- Need to have Maven installed and active, using said Java 17 (See my earlier videos on how to setup Java+Maven)
- Need to have a few gigabytes of memory to spare (Stanford NLP is kinda heavy)

Run:

´´´
mvn clean package
java
´´´

Or, alternatively, open in VSCode and run like I did in the video.

Find App.java file, play with it.
Find comments.txt file, replace with your own stuff to analyze.
Go to Stanford pages, read the docs, you can also run the NLP tool from the command line without any Mavens etc.
